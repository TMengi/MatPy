Linear algebra operations for Python.
=======
I wrote some documentation for this a while ago but I can't figure out where it went. Maybe I got rid of it because I had so many bugs. Will have to rewrite and put it here.

Currently taking a linear algebra class at UCLA and thought it would be neat to try and code some of the algorithms for it. That quickly developed into just writing all the matrix operations I could think of, which developed into writing vector and set operations, so on and so forth. Here we are.

THERE ARE A TON OF BUGS. Currently trying to write a bunch of tests to find the kinks and work them all out.
