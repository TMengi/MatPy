Linear algebra operations for Python.

Currently taking a linear algebra class at UCLA and thought it would be neat to try and code some of the algorithms for it. That quickly developed into just writing all the matrix operations I could think of, which developed into writing vector and set operations, so on and so forth. Here we are.

THERE ARE A TON OF BUGS. Currently trying to write a bunch of tests to find the kinks and work them all out.
